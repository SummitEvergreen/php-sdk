## Composer

You can install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Add this to your `composer.json`:

    {
      "require": {
        "summitevergreen/summit-php": "~1.0.0"
      }
    }

Then install via:

    composer.phar install

To use the bindings, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

    require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

## Getting Started

Sample usage adding a purchase for a customer:

```
use SummitEvergreen\Summit;

// Add your Account ID and Account API Key
$summit = new Summit('A1B2C3D4E5','9ec05a816a63e99e218b88a69614f313c29082be');

$purchaseInfo = [
    'email' => 'luke@example.com',
    'first_name' => 'Luke',
    'last_name' => 'Skywalker',
    'price' => 199.00,
    'sku' => 'COURSE1000'
];

$purchase = $summit->setPurchaseData($purchaseInfo);

// Returns a JSON-ecoding string with the purchase data (see below)
$return = $purchase->addPurchase();
```

We also support Fluent method chaining:

```
$purchase = $summit->setPurchaseData($purchaseInfo)->addPurchase();
```

To **refund** the purchase, send the same information but with a different final method.

```
$purchase = $summit->setPurchaseData($purchaseInfo)->doRefund();
```

**Note:** `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `price`, and `sku` are all required fields for **both** purchases and refunds.

You can include `order_id` if you have generated your own, or the API will generate one for you.

You may also include `payment_id` from your system for tracking purposes.
_If you include the `payment_id`, you **must** include the `order_id` as well._

Returned Data
-------------
The **Summit Evergreen** API and this SDK will return a JSON-encoded array as follows:

```
{
message: "{Operation success message}",
errors: [ ],
order_id: "54f8b72da6c94",
thankyou_url: "{Full URL to Thank You page for customer}"
}
```
